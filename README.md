# Testing-Out-Finch-Bird-Bot

I wanted to learn how to code so that the Finch Bird Bot will work what I have in mind and applying my skill in 3D modeling to create a simple mini game for people to play with.

## Code to Highlight

### Explanation of the Code

- Line 3: <br /><br />Creates a Finch class named ***a***.<br /><br />
- Line 4: <br /><br />Creates a boolean variable ***canKeepGoing*** in the case that if I want to stop the Finch Bot under certain condition I can code that in using that variable.<br /><br />
- Line 6-8: <br /><br />Creates three int variable that randomizes how much the Finch Robot can move forward, how much to turn and what sound should it make.<br /><br />
- Line 10-11: <br /><br />If the Finch Bot detects that if the variable ***move*** is greater than or equal to the distance bewteen the robot and what the robot can detect then move only the distance bewteen the obstacle and the Finch Bot.<br /><br />
- Line 15-17:<br /><br />Move the Finch bot equal to ***move*** distance, then do a ***turn*** degree turn and finally make a sound that notify the people that it finishes it current action and is going to the next action.<br /><br />

## Reasons

- What was my motivation?
  <br /><br />My motivation was to learn the basic of how to create a 3D model and using that model, create a code that will be sent to the Finch bot to create a game that people can play with.<br /><br />
- Why did you build this project?
  <br /><br />I coded this program in order to create a mini game where something will be on the top of the Finch Bot and the robot will move in an unexpected pattern which the player will try to throw a ball on the top of the bot.<br /><br />
- What did I learned?
  <br /><br />I learned many things from creating and learning how to make a 3D model to learning and creating segments of code that will be used by the Finch robot. First, I learn how to create model in tinkercad and customize my own "shape" or "model" since not everything you have in mind is there for you. Then, I learn how to code for the Finch bot in Java so the robot can move according to the mini game I have in mind. Finally, I would want to made sure everything "fits" like check if there is a adjustment I want to make in the code or adjustment to the model so it can be fit on the robot.
